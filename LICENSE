This is a faithful photographic reproduction of a two-dimensional, [public domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) work of art. The work of art itself is in the public domain for the following reason:

Public domain	
This work is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the [copyright term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths) is the author's life plus 100 years or fewer.

This work is in the public domain in the United States because it was [published](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Publication) (or registered with the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Copyright_Office)) before January 1, 1927.

[This file has been identified as being free of known restrictions under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/deed.en).

The official position taken by the Wikimedia Foundation is that "faithful reproductions of two-dimensional public domain works of art are public domain".
This photographic reproduction is therefore also considered to be in the public domain in the United States. In other jurisdictions, re-use of this content may be restricted; see [Reuse of PD-Art photographs](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Reuse_of_PD-Art_photographs) for details.
